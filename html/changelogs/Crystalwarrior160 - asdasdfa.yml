changes:
  - tweak: "Removes detain mode due to it existing solely for that stunlock (which is actually useless 99% of the time and only exists to be a cunt to people)"
  - tweak: "Reduces stun duration for harmbatoning"
  - bugfix: "Adds 'alternative detective fedora' which replaces the purely cosmetic one in det's locker (which was confusing, stupid, dumb and stupid)"
