  - rscadd: "!!MASSIVE MARTIAL ARTS REWORK!!"
  - rscadd: "==="
  - rscdel: "Pinning people down is no longer possible unless you have an appropriate martial art."
  - experiment: "Security Officers, including the Detective, now spawn with a Krav Maga Martial Art! Krav Maga martial art functions differently from it's /tg/ counterpart. Hippie Station's version lets you pin people down, as well as perform robust disarms that instantly put the weapon in your hands."
  - rscadd: "- You can now perform a pindown if you attack your opponent with grab item, with disarm intent, in AGGRESSIVE grab stage."
  - rscadd: "Ported Atlas Station wrestling with a bunch of tweaks! There are too many possible moves that you can perform to list their executions here, but, here's what you can do:"
  - rscadd: "- Clinch (50% Aggro Grab chance), Backhand Chop, Chop Drop, Choke Slam, Back Breaker, Moonsault, Corkscrew Elbow Drop, Suplex, Tombstone Piledriver, Cutter/RKO and finally, the Powerbomb!"
  - rscadd: "Completely rewritten the CQC martial art to be more faithful to the Metal Gear franchise, as well as making it very viable in 1v1 surprise attacks."
  - rscadd: "Current CQC moves:"
  - rscadd: "- Clinch (50% Aggro Grab chance)"
  - rscadd: "- Roundhouse Kick (5-hit combo, KO)"
  - rscadd: "- Face Slam (Neck Grab + Harm Intent + attack w/ grab, KO, small brute)"
  - rscadd: "- Robust Disarm (Same as Krav Maga - instantly puts weapon in-hand, sacrifices push down chance)"
  - rscadd: "- Karate Chop (Neck Grab + Disarm Intent + attack w/ grab, +20 Staminaloss, makes victim confused)"
  - rscadd: "- Half-wing choke (Replaces choking, twice as fast to perform, adds +20 staminaloss on attempt)"
  - rscadd: "Plasma Fist Martial Art was completely rewritten to make your punches MUCH faster, but some combos are harder to execute!"
  - rscadd: "Current Plasma Fist moves (H = Harm, D = Disarm, G = Grab):"
  - rscadd: "- TORNADO COMBO! Throws all opponents in-range away from you (HHD)"
  - rscadd: "- THROWBACK PUNCH! Throws your opponent backwards and lights them on fire (DHD)"
  - rscadd: "- KNOCKOUT KICK! Weakens opponent, deals hefty damage (GGH)"
  - rscadd: "- THE ULTIMATE PLASMA FIST TECHNIQUE! Gibs opponent similarly to Ei Nath. Leaves brain. (GHDGHDH)"
  - experiment: "Plasma Fist has been added as a buyable scroll for Wizard. It costs 8 skill points due to it's sheer, powerful potential and due to the fact that you're basically buying a spell bundle. The cost is subject to change based on player feedback."
  - tweak: "Reduced all grab resist cooldowns from 10 seconds to 5 seconds."
  - tweak: "Added a sound effect and visible_message to being slammed into walls by throws"
  - tweak: "Now resisting out of pindowns will always let victim get up faster than assailant"
  - tweak: "Being tablepushed onto a glass table now gives you 5 brute and has a chance to embed the shard into you."
  - bugfix: "Fixed teleporting issue with grabs"
