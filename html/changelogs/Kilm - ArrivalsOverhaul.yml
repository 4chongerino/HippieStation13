changes: 
  - rscadd: "Complete Arrivals overhaul. This area now has a customs feature whereby Sec can, if they want, man it and search those joining the station late. It just adds a bit more depth to a historically underused area of the station and gives potential for antag use."
  - rscdel: "The old Arrivals sec checkpoint is now the 'Invasive Search Area'"
  - bugfix: "Sorted out no power to the two APC's in the Brig"
