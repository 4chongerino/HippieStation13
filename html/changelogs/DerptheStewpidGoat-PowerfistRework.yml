changes: 
  - tweak: "Power fist code changed greatly to make it perform better to cause less lag on the server."
  - tweak: "Power fist cooldown has been readded BUT it uses a different system so that rather than having a random 0 - 2 second cooldown which was very unreliable you now only have a slightly-longer-than-normal cooldown which is practically always the same. New cool-down system also lets admins set the cooldown to literally 0 so they can pulverize someone as fast as they can click."
  - tweak: "Power fist now takes armor into account and no longer does stamina damage but can punch through any kind of window or grille instantly. Power fist cost has NOT been changed."
