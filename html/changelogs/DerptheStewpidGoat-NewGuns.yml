changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added 4 new guns! These guns are the Mac-10 SMG chambered in 9mm, C05-R (Mauser C96) chambered in .45 ACP, P057A Luger (PO-8 Luger) chambered in .357, and .44 Automag chambered in .44 AMP. Credits to Nienhaus for the majority of the sprites."
  - rscadd: "All guns except for the automag are currently summon-guns exclusive. A single automag spawns on the bar counter with the nuke ops leader. It has a 7-round magazine and does a very formidable amount of damage. Also has some armor-piercing traits which makes it dangerous even to users of a bulletproof vest. The ammo that comes with the automag is the only ammo that nuke ops can ever get for it, so it is advised that you conserve your ammo."
