changes: 
  - tweak: "Syringes, IVs, and other injectiables now use INJECT as a method of applying chems, instead of INJEST."
  - rscadd: "Saline-Glucose Solution can be used as a substitute blood replacement if injected, either by syringe or IV drip. It isn't as effective as normal blood, but can be used in a pinch, or to 'water down' blood to make it last longer."
  - tweak: "Traitors poison kit now starts with a syringe."
